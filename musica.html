        I didn't think you'd understand me<br>
        How could you ever even try?<br>
        I don't wanna tiptoe, but I don't wanna hide<br>
        But I don't wanna feed this monstrous fire<br>
        Just wanna let this story die<br>
        And I'll be alright<br>
<br>
        We can't be friends<br>
        But I'd like to just pretend<br>
        You cling to your papers and pens<br>
        Wait until you like me again<br>
<br>
        Wait for your love<br>
        My love, I'll wait for your love<br>
<br>
        Me and my truth, we sit in silence, mmm<br>
        Baby girl, it's just me and you<br>
        'Cause I don't wanna argue, but I don't wanna bite<br>
        My tongue, yeah, I think I'd rather die<br>
        You got me misunderstood, but at least I look this good<br>
<br>
        We can't be friends<br>
        But I'd like to just pretend<br>
        You cling to your papers and pens<br>
        Wait until you like me again<br>
<br>
        Wait for your love<br>
        My love, I'll wait for your love<br>
        I'll wait for your love<br>
        My love, I'll wait for your love<br>
<br>
        Know that you made me<br>
        I don't like how you paint me, yet I'm still here hanging<br>
        Not what you made me<br>
        It's something like a daydream<br>
        But I feel so seen in the night<br>
        So for now it's only me<br>
        And maybe that's all I need<br>
<br>
        We can't be friends<br>
        But I'd like to just pretend<br>
        You cling to your papers and pens<br>
        Wait until you like me again<br>
<br>
        Wait for your love<br>
        My love, I'll wait for your love<br>
        I'll wait for your love<br>
        My love, I'll wait for your love<br>
<br>
        I'll wait for your love<br>
        I'll wait for your love<br>
        I'll wait for your love<br>
        I'll wait for your love<br>
        I'll wait for your love<br>
